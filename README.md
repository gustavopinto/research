Research Ideas
=============

This is my personal research repository, but here I mostly keep **ideas** for future research. 

The way that it works is simple: when some research topic blow up in my mind, I open an issue for that, and I write as much as I can. 

I don't plan to work on such ideas in my next free time. 

Instead, I brainstorm on them. In particular, I try to find good reasons to put effort on them (e.g. is it hard? is it an interesting problem? does someone have done it before?). Based on the answers for such questions, I decide if I throw the topic away, or I will invest my time on it.

Did you like one of these topics and want to work with me? Please, let me know.
