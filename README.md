Research Ideas
=============

This is my personal research repository, but here I mostly keep **ideas** for future research. 

The way that it works is simple: when some research topic blow up in my mind, I open an issue for that, and I write as much as I can. 

I don't plan to work on such ideas in my next free time. 

Instead, I brainstorm on them. In particular, I try to find good reasons to put effort and time on them (e.g. is it an interesting problem? does someone have done it before?). If the hypothesis is not valid, I throw the topic away.
